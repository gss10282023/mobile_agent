# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security problems. Instead, use GitHub
Security Advisories (preferred) or contact the maintainers at
maintainers@your-domain.example.

When reporting, include:
- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs or screenshots (with sensitive data removed)

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure.
